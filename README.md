# Hydrosphere

This repository includes a collection of codes and figures used to model the profiles of water-rich exoplanets and icy moons. The codes included here are variations of the HydroSphere code generated by Baptiste Journaux and allow the user to model planetary hydrospheres with high pressure ices. Also included in this repository are codes which generate GIFs of the thermal and phase profiles of a planet as it cools over time.
